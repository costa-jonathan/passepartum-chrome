<b>Storage</b>\
<br>\
Your login data is stored <b>locally</b> and <b>unencrypted</b> (using <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/storage/" target="_blank">this feature</a>).\
This means anybody with access to your computers local storage can theoretically (if they know where to look) \
access your password, even if that access is a remote one (like Team Viewer or potential spyware). \
It is not synchronized via cloud storage, which means it <b>cannot</b> be leaked by an external data breach or \
by somebody monitoring your network traffic. \
<br>\
<br>\
<b>Why do we compare the security to that of the chrome/edge password autofill feature?</b>\
<br>\
Because if someone with access to your computer would go to the login page of moodle and your passwords gets autofilled, \
it is a matter of a few clicks to copy the password out of the password field. \
<br>\
<br>\
<b>The Developers</b>\
<br>\
There is no person with a background in information security working on this extension.\
<br>\
<br>\
<b>What if you don\'t provide the login data?</b>\
<br>\
You can still use this extension even without providing your TUM login. It will still save you one or \
two click here and there. \
